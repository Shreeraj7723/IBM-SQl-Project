# SQL & Python Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of SQL and Python to perform effective data analysis within a relational database environment. The primary objective was to analyze and manipulate data using SQL queries and Python scripting to extract meaningful insights.

## Features
- Connected to a relational database using Python libraries (e.g., `sqlite3`, `SQLAlchemy`).
- Created and managed multiple tables using **Data Definition Language (DDL)** commands.
- Constructed basic to intermediate **SQL queries** using **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** commands.
- Utilized advanced SQL techniques such as **joins, views, transactions, and stored procedures**.
- Extracted query results into Python for further data analysis and visualization.
- Automated data processing tasks by combining SQL and Python capabilities.

## Technologies Used
- SQL (SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL)
- Python (pandas, sqlite3, SQLAlchemy)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
